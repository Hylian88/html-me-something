        <p> 
            SSBM is short for "Super Smash Brother: Melee", a game for the Nintendo gamecube.
            I started playing this game in 2001, and attending tournaments for it in 2003. The scene was pretty small back then,
            but was growing fast. Over the years I've attended tournaments all over the nation and met hundreds of people I never would have otherwise.
            On this page I'll talk about some of the tournaments I've attended and places I've visited.

            <header><h2>Apex</h2></header>
            <p>
                Apex was one of the largest smash events of it's time, hosting all of the smash games instead of just melee.
                It was home to many famous moments and pictures. The series was disbanded after some controversy with its owner,
                but many still have fond memories of it. In Apex 2009 I placed 13th in melee and 25th in brawl out of several hundred competitors.
                Apex saw some of the first time japanese players came to america to compete in tournaments, the picture below depicts a japanese player upsetting one of the best players in the world.

                <p>
                    Evoultion is the largest fighting game tournament in the world. It is the super bowl of fighting games.
                    Evo typically hosts 7-9 fighting games in its tournament with thousands of attendies. In 2013,
                    it held a charity donation drive for games that had never been at Evo before. SSBM won the donation drive,
                    donating over $100,000 to breast cancer research. This was a historic moment for smash as it had never been taken seriously
                    as a fighting game before, and it got a platform on the largest fighting game tournament in the world.
                    After this event and with a documentary that came out about the scene, the smash scene exploded.
                    Today, it is one of the largest fighting games in the world, even though it is 15 years old. There are huge tournaments
                    every months with thousands of dollars in prize money, and an estabilished ranking of players.
